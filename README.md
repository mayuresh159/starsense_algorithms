# starsense_algorithms
This is a software package for testing and performance evaluation of various star sensors. The algorithms used are : centroiding, geometric voting and QUEST algorithms. The physical parameters of a star sensor are parametrized and by changing these parameters various performance estimators like sky coverage, memory requirement, timing requirements etc can be estimated for the selected star sensor.
